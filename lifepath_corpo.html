              <p>Corpos are most at home in the board room and rising the corporate ladder. They are familiar with doing whatever it takes, often at the expense of social perception, to progress further their ambitions and status in a society that values only wealth and status in 2077.
                As such, a Corpo's cynicism gives the benefit of seeing through lies and being able to read between the lines when trying to do business or negotiate with others.</p>
